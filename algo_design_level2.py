=============================================================
  LEVEL 2 — Top-Down Design: Building a Report System
  Apply structure-chart thinking in real code.
=============================================================

In this level you'll build a simple student report program
using TOP-DOWN DESIGN. The structure looks like this:

        run_report_system()
        /         |         \
get_student()  calculate_stats()  display_report()
                   /       \
           find_highest()  find_average()

You'll write each subroutine separately, then connect them.
